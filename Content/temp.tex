    Let $L^{\infty}(X)$ be the set of essentially bounded functions on X.

    Define the $L^{\infty}$ norm by $||f||_{\infty}$ = inf(all essential bounds).

    Show $||f||_{\infty}$ is itself and essential bound on f.

    $|f|$ $\leq$ $||f||_{\infty}$ on some complement of a null set

    For each n, there is a $\mu(E_n)$ = 0 such that
    $|f|$ $\leq$ $||f||_{\infty} + \frac{1}{n}$ on $E_n^c$

    Take E = $\cap E^c$ = $(\cup E_n)^c$ which is a complement of a null set
    where $|f|$ $\leq$ $||f||_{\infty}$ on E.
